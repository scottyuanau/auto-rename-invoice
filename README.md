# Auto Rename Invoice

The app automatically renames a file to add today's date, for accounting book keeping purposes.

The app would check if the file ends with a number, and would rename the file if it doesn't.

If duplicated name found, the app would add a number at the end to avoid duplication.

The app checks the folder every 10 seconds, and can be configed in the settings.
